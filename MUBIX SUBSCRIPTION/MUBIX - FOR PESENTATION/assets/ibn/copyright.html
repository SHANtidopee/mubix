                <h2>Terms Of Use</h2>
                <p>Last Edit: 06/07/2023</p>
                <p>Greetings Users,</p>
                <p>These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. 
                    As used in these Terms of Use, "Netflix service", 
                    "our service" or "the service" means the personalized service provided by Netflix for discovering and
                    accessing Netflix content, including all features and functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our websites, 
                    and user interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with our service. References to ‘you’ in these 
                    Terms of Use indicate the member who created the Netflix account and whose payment method is charged.</p>

                <h4>1. Membership</h4>     
                <p>
                    Your Netflix membership will continue until terminated. To use the Netflix service you must have Internet access
                    and a Netflix ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. “Payment Method” means a current, valid, 
                    accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which may include payment through your account with a third party.
                    Unless you cancel your membership before your billing date, you authorize us to charge the membership fee for the next 
                    billing cycle to your Payment Method (see "Cancellation" below). <br>
                </p>
                
                <h4>2. Promotional Offers</h4>
                <p>
                    We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans or memberships (“Offers”). Offer eligibility is determined by 
                    Netflix at its sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke an Offer and put your account on hold in the event that we determine 
                    you are not eligible. Members of households with an existing or recent Netflix membership may not be eligible for certain introductory Offers.
                    We may use information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent Netflix membership
                    to determine Offer eligibility. The eligibility requirements and other limitations and conditions will be disclosed when you sign-up for 
                    the Offer or in other communications made available to you.
                </p>

                <h4>3. Billing and Cancellation</h4>
                <p>
                    To use the Netflix service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated to your 
                    account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible
                    for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not 
                    cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, 
                    the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Local
                    tax charges may vary depending on the Payment Method used. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
                </p>

                <h4>4. Netflix Service</h4>
                <p>
                    The Netflix service and any content accessed through the service are for your personal and non-commercial use only and may not be shared with 
                    individuals beyond your household unless otherwise allowed by your subscription plan. During your Netflix membership we grant you a limited,
                    non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access the Netflix service and Netflix content. Except for the foregoing, no right, title or interest 
                    shall be transferred to you. You agree not to use the service for public performances.
                </p>

                <h4>5. Passwords and Account Access</h4>
                <p> You are responsible for any activity that occurs through the Netflix account. By allowing others to access the account (which includes access 
                    to information on viewing activity for the account), you agree that such individuals are acting on your behalf and that you are bound by any
                     changes that they may make to the account, including but not limited to changes to the subscription plan. To help maintain control over the
                    account and to prevent any unauthorized users from accessing the account, you should maintain control over the devices that are used to
                    access the service and not reveal the password or details of the Payment Method associated with the account to anyone. You agree to provide
                    and maintain accurate information relating to your account, including a valid email address so we can send you account related notices. 
                    We can terminate your account or place your account on hold in order to protect you, Netflix or our partners from identity theft or other
                    fraudulent activity.</p>
